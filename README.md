## Oh, hi there! ðŸ‘‹

After a career as an accidental Digital Marketer in the travel industry, I've decided to merge my knowledge of content writing and SEO with my curiosity for web development and UX. 

I'm currently studying web development and software engineering on an immersive 12-week coding bootcamp with Code Nation.

The repos you'll see on my GitHub, as well as my projects on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jennyhmc), are an insight into my coding journey so far.

Some fast facts:
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning about the wonderful world of Javascript.
- â˜• Unlike most developers, I'm unique in that I'm fuelled by copious mugs of tea.
- âš¡ Unpopular opinions: Dogs are better than cats / Mountains over beaches / Avocados suck.
